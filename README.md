# 🔋 AI Battery State of Health (SOH) Predictor

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project implements an **Artificial Intelligence–based Battery Management System (BMS)** explicitly designed to predict the **State of Health (SOH)** of batteries.

While **State of Charge (SOC)** acts as a *"fuel gauge"* indicating how much energy remains for immediate use, **SOH** acts as a *"physician's report,"* revealing the overall lifespan and structural integrity of the battery. It is crucial for detecting long-term degradation, internal resistance buildup, and capacity fade before a catastrophic failure occurs.

The system utilizes a **Deep LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)** neural network, trained on high-fidelity aging profiles from the **NASA Prognostics Center of Excellence (PCoE)**. Unlike simple lookup tables that fail as batteries age, this model analyzes the *"slope"* and velocity of voltage and temperature changes over a **10-step time window**. By observing these temporal dynamics, the AI can estimate the battery's remaining useful capacity with high accuracy, even under varying load conditions.

## 📊 Performance Metrics

The model has been rigorously trained and optimized for **low-latency inference**, making it suitable for deployment on **edge devices** (like Raspberry Pi or ESP32) or **cloud-based monitoring servers**.

| **Metric** | **Value** | **Description** |
|------------|-----------|-----------------|
| **Model Architecture** | Deep LSTM | 2 Stacked Layers (128 & 64 Units) with Dropout for robust generalization. |
| **Input Window** | 10 Steps | Captures the last ~2.5 minutes of sensor history to determine trend direction. |
| **MAE (Error)** | ~4.23% | The average deviation from the actual health. (e.g., A prediction of 80% is reliably between 76–84%). |
| **RMSE** | ~5.86% | Root Mean Square Error, indicating a low susceptibility to extreme outlier errors. |
| **Inference Time** | < 50ms | Highly efficient, enabling real-time health monitoring without system lag. |

## 🧠 How It Works

The system operates on a continuous feedback loop, transforming raw, noisy sensor data into actionable health insights:

### 1. Data Ingestion
The system pulls live sensor streams ($Voltage$, $Current$, $Temperature$) via the ThingSpeak API or a direct local serial connection. This stage handles data synchronization to ensure valid inputs.

### 2. Windowing (Temporal Context)
Instead of analyzing a single data point, the system buffers the last **10 data points**.

**The "Why":**  
A degraded battery and a healthy battery might show the same voltage at rest. However, under load, a degraded battery's voltage drops significantly faster. The LSTM requires this *"moving window"* to detect that specific decay curve.

### 3. Inference
The buffered data is normalized (scaled to 0–1 range) to match the training distribution and fed into the `.keras` model. The LSTM layers process the sequence to extract deep temporal features related to chemical aging.

### 4. Output
The model outputs a single scalar value ($0\% - 100\%$) representing the SOH. This is calculated as the ratio of the Current Maximum Capacity to the Original Nominal Capacity.

## 🚀 Setup & Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ajayjai30/Battery-Mangement-System-Lead-Acid-Batteries.git
cd Battery-Mangement-System-Lead-Acid-Batteries
```

---

### 2. Install Dependencies

Ensure you are running a compatible Python environment (**3.10+**) and install the required libraries:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

### 3. Usage (Real-Time Cloud Loop)

To start the automated bridge that pulls live data from ThingSpeak, processes the health metrics, and logs the SOH to the console:

```bash
python thingspeak_bridge.py
```

**Note:**  
You must update the `THINGSPEAK_CHANNEL_ID` and `API_KEY` variables inside the script to match your specific IoT channel.

---

### 4. Usage (Custom Python Script)

You can easily import the predictor logic into your own custom dashboard or automation script:

```python
from bms_predictor import BMS_Predictor

# Initialize the AI engine with the trained artifacts
ai = BMS_Predictor(
    model_path='models/bms_soh_model_best.keras',
    scaler_x_path='scalers/scaler_X_soh.pkl',
    scaler_y_path='scalers/scaler_y_soh.pkl',
    window_size=10  # Must match the training window
)

# Simulate feeding live data (Voltage, Current, Temp)
# The predictor returns 'None' while it fills the 10-step buffer
soh_prediction = ai.predict_realtime(12.4, -1.5, 28.5)

if soh_prediction:
    print(f"Current Battery Health: {soh_prediction:.2f}%")
else:
    print("Buffering data... (Need 10 data points)")
```
